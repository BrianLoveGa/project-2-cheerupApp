# project-2-cheerupApp
******

An app that will allow people to create and share "Cheer Ups" - happy little notes to brighten other peoples' days.

******

__Cheerups__

The world can be a depressing place. Your task is to create an app that will allow people to create and share "Cheer Ups" - happy little quips to brighten other peoples' days. Cheer Ups will be small - limited to 141 characters.

*Members will be able to promote Cheer Ups that they like and maybe even boost the reputation of the Cheer Upper.
*bonus

*****

__Goals__


__Bronze__ 

An app where cheerups can be viewed by public (users)- and new ones created / editable / deleteable . Deployed via Heroku & Atlas sites. 

__Silver__ 

Users profiles exist (Passport working). Then they can make new cheerups. Also edit and delete ones they made. 

Silver and a half

Let users sign in with a third-party account (Facebook & or GitHub ).

__Gold__

Let users choose one of three background colors.

Users can upvote / down vote the cherr ups like reddit or stackoverflow.

*bonus

__Platinum__

Cheerups will be shown by rank on main page.

Your profile shows if any of your cheerups are in top nine on main page. 

Have favorites - you voted for show up when you log in.

Click a user to see ones they made.

__Planning__

Started with this as my template with high aspirations .

And here's my crude plan for routing and connections .

__Current Features__

Full CRUD (create read update delete) / RESTful routes for users and cheer ups.

The login page is really just for decoration until I can get Passport Auth fully working. SHould have started there and added cheerups instead of building user routes and trying to change them over after they were built.

Css on all pages. but the view from local host and the view on live chrome page is a little different - also the green second header bar floats wierd in Firefox ... My Mom and Girlfriend were able to access it and see it on their phones. Still needs more but want to add more features before style at this point.

And although it still needs some minor tweeking it is at least technically correct and error free so far.

__My testers__

Huge thanks to Ma Familia - My favorite testing group!

<!-- my Dad made a new cheerup and I saw it -->

My Dad was able to acces and post a Cheer Up !

<!-- my Mom and Sis made a post too!  -->

My Mom and Sis made posts too - I know my Mom only has her phone for internet so it at least mostly renders ok on small screens.

<!-- my Sis (darocklobsta) & Girlfriend (Hotmom92) were able to make accounts! Whoo-Hoo!  -->

My Sis (Heather Nicole) & Girlfriend (Michelle Fryer) were able to make accounts! Whoo-Hoo! 
Although it will be much cooler when I can actually get passport auth  working so the login does something and I can keep any meanies away.

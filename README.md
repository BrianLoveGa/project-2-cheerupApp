Cheerups
The world can be a depressing place. Your task is to create an app that will allow people to create and share "cheerups" - happy little quips to brighten other peoples' days. Cheerups will be small - limited to 141 characters. Members will be able to promote Cheerups that they like and maybe even boost the reputation of the Cheerupper.

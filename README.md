Cheerups
The world can be a depressing place. Your task is to create an app that will allow people to create and share "cheerups" - happy little quips to brighten other peoples' days. Cheerups will be small - limited to 141 characters. Members will be able to promote Cheerups that they like and maybe even boost the reputation of the Cheerupper.

Let users sign in with a third-party account (Facebook & or GitHub ).

__Gold__

Let users choose one of three background colors.

Users can upvote / down vote the cherups like reddit or stackoverflow or twitter


__Platnium__
